## Technologies Used

I just wanted to mention that I wanted to use Bootstrap, not only because it was the main example provided in our course but also because I was not familiar at all with it. It was a challenge to understand how it worked and how to build a website around it. I will mention more during the deployment and testing phase.
The website is willingly simple of use, straightforward to have all the information needed.

- HTML
    - All the website was built with HTML using the resources available on Bootscrap and w3schools mostly adapted to build something consistent.

- CSS
    - The styling is built with CSS, trying to use different techniques and adaptations.

- Resources
    - [Pixabay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees) for pictures (homepage and headers)
    - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvqeSJlgaNk) for the video implementation in "Music"
    - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for the javascript and some features (cards, form, carousel) 
    - [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for the "our album" script allowing to switch from one album to another
    - [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) in order to build the timeline (Events) and the footer and for The Monkees pictures
    - [Google Images](https://www.google.com) for some extra pictures of the band (in Music fo example) - beware this is for educational purposer only as some images might have copyright on them


## Testing

At the beginning of the project I really wanted to work around one single scrolling page but I had to adapt my project for a better reading purpose. I was not feeling confident it would work the way I wanted it and it would not be as smooth for the user. For a better user experience I worked around one page per item. 

1. Overall navigation / footer:
    1. Tested all links on a desktop and a mobile as a collapsable menu will appear.
    2. Tried to make sure all animations, smooth transition where applied everywhere.
    3. Added a "home" button on the collapsable menu as it was not there on the navigation bar (also making sure it did not appear on the navbar)
    4. Make sure that the navigation bar was also on top using the "sticky top" feature. 
    5. For the pages other than "Homepage" - Wanted an header with a sticky image on the backgroung to add more effect (not working on every devices like iphone/impact but does not impact the overall use of the website)
    2. On mobile devices - realized the logo of the band was not there as we have a collapsable menu so in order to remind the user where he is, tried to include the band logo in every pages

Note: The navigation bar was quite a challenge to implement. Having to style the collapsable bar while also thinking about the desktop one was really time consuming. I wanted different features (ie the collapsable menu to take all the page on mobile devices) but I had to simplify in order to process with the rest of the development. But it certainly would be a "step 2" in improving the website.

2. Homepage:
    1. Tested the carousel on different devices, seems that the arrow is moving when approching it and might get stuck on some devices.
    2. Tried to make sure that everything was consistent (image stopping when mouse comes on it, shadow disappearing from the image...)
    3. Tried to swipe the image with the finger on a mobile to make it more UX friendly.
    4. Noticed that with an iphone, the footer tents to disappear under the bottom bar - same if the call is made at the same time (top green block moving the aspect of the website)

Note: The carousel was quite difficult to implement as I was adding different features one by one, I wanted the shadow on the images that I had to build myself from online resources. I also wanted the whole page to fit only to the screen with no scrollbar. I managed to make it possible on some devices but as I mentionned the footer sometimes desappear. I had to compromise to make it look good but also useful. 
I also thought about a link on the whole picture but then it would have been confusing with the arrow of the carousel so I settle for a button instead.

3. News:
    1. First page created and the simplest one as we only have a few blocks on display 
    2. The images disappear on mobile devices to ease the reading

4. The band:
    1. Used "Cards" tool from bootstrap - made sure all the "cards" stocked on top of each other on mobile devices
 
5. Our music:
    1. The video is embedded directly from Youtube, tested it to make sure it worked and fits everywhere
    2. Used the "tabs" tool from w3schools so had to make sure the design matched and adapted it for images and music links
    3. Tried the audio link that is also disappearing completely id the navigator is not supporting this code - it also disappear on mobiles to ease the reading of the page

6. Events:
    1. Wanted some kind of gallery to add some pictures to the page. Had to work around to make them fit nicely and stack devepending on the device size. They also disappear on mobiles to help the page charge quickly.
    2. Really wanted to implement the timeline from the course example as it fit nicely and is quite straightforward for the events
    
3. Contact:
    1. On mobile the logos appear while on desktop is a band pictures. Here again it was to remind what we were talking about (the monkees) but also to help the page charge quickly on mobile devices
    2. The form was tested, some areas are mandatory - used Bootstrap for the overall form
    3. Added a date input for enquiries about an event - choose this aspect instead of a Google Calendar for the overall look

## Deployment

The "blank" running code of Could9 was used most of the time. It was quite a challenge at first because the command did not really fit as you have to process into a particular order.
Then I committed on Git every time a new page was build and with an almost "finished" status.

Also due to the upcoming migration with AWS it was chosen to finish the website on Cloud9 and to deploy it from there to avoid any transfer issue.
